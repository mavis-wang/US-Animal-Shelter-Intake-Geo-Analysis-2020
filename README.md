### Motivation
According to ASPCA, there are 6.5 million dogs/cats entering animal shelters in the U.S. every year. Each year, approximately 1.5 million of them are euthanized. Local shelters are facing challenges to handle such an amount of intakes due to limited resources. In this project, we investigated and visualized a series of pets data and statistics in the U.S. to understand what causes animal intakes in shelters and the implied correlation.

### Dataset 
- [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/)
- [Learn how to Petfinder API](https://github.com/helenuria/Petfinder-API)
  
### Goal
1. Provide actionable insights to help animal shelters reduce the crowdedness
2. Decrease period of animal stays in a shelter
3. Improve adoption rate

### Analytics
- [x] Measure of Crowdedness
- [x] Seasonal Trend by States
- [x] Intakes and Breeders Correlation
- [x] Geographic intakes and trend analysis
  
### Dashboard [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gnawsivam/viz/2020USShelterAnimalIntakeDistribution/StoryIntakes)
A series of interactive visualizations of animal intake analysis by states.
