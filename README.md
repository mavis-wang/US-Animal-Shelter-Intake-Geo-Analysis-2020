### Motivation
According to ASPCA, there are 6.5 million dogs/cats entering animal shelters in the U.S. every year. Each year, approximately 1.5 million of them are euthanized. Local shelters are facing challenges to handle such an amount of intakes due to limited resources. In this project, we investigated and visualized a series of pets data and statistics in the U.S. to understand what causes animal intakes in shelters and the implied correlation.

### Goal
Help Animal shelters improve adoption rate for dogs and cats by providing actionable insights.

### Solutions
1. Metrics: Overcrowding Rate (OR) and Imbalance Index. 
2. Early detection/prediction of overcrowding problems.
3. Identify imbalanced animal distribution to help relocate based on logistics.
4. Decrease the period of animal stays in a shelter.
5. Encourage adoption through hosting events and social channels.
